# Testing, testing...

This framework is intended for use as the USC Image Understanding Lab's integrated subject testing platform.
From here, we'll be able to automatically proctor and score image recognition tasks.

## To do

To keep things manageable, I'm maintaining a linear to do list.

- [ ] Add archived image uploading into some merged asset directory
- [ ] Create a test model for persistence and runtime access
- [ ] Create the test framework in SQL
- [ ] Create API endpoints for single page clients to run tests
- [ ] Finish the testing suite
- [ ] Add separation layer to conform to HIPAA
- [ ] Write up that last bit
