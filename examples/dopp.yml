  # Create a new template for a slide. This one allows users to rate
  # their familiarity with the named celebrity on a scale of 1 to 10.
  survey:

    # Inputs are the exact key codes used by HTML/JavaScript that are
    # accepted as a response to the stimuli. They can be listed or
    # provided as a map from the key code to the value that should be
    # stored as the response.
    inputs:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4
      - 5

    # There are two options for storing results. The first is value,
    # which stores the input if options are provided as a list. If the
    # inputs are mapped, the value is looked up and stored. The second
    # is correct, which is demonstrated below.
    store: value

    # Instructions are shown below the stimuli on all slides.
    instructions: 1 - very unfamiliar, 3 - vaguely familiar, 5 - very familiar

  # This template will be used for slides where the user has to choose
  # which picture is of the real celebrity.
  choice:

    # Left and Right correspond to the left and right arrow keys.
    inputs:
      - Left
      - Right

    # Storing correct either returns true or false based on whether
    # what the user answers matches the options specified in the
    # correct field of the slide, as demonstrated below.
    store: correct

    instructions: Use left and right to select the celebrity

# Slides are the actual displays subjects are shown
